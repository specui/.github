Welcome to **SpecUI**! ðŸŽ‰

SpecUI is a spec-first development framework that makes building user interfaces intuitive and efficient. By writing simple yet powerful specs in YAML, JSON, or TypeScript, you can generate robust code for any language, framework, or format. From complex web applications to mobile apps and API services, SpecUI empowers you to ship faster than ever.

**Key Repositories:**
- [**specui/specui**](https://github.com/specui/specui): The core project that brings your specs to life, enabling rapid UI development.
  - [examples/](https://github.com/specui/specui/tree/main/examples): Ready-to-use spec samples to kickstart your projects.
  - [generators/](https://github.com/specui/specui/tree/main/generators): Customizable code generators for various languages and frameworks.
- [**specui/openui**](https://github.com/specui/openui): A language-agnostic interface specification designed to standardize UI definitions and make your development process seamless.
